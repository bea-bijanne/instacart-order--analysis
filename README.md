# Instacart Orders Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Instacart order data to uncover purchasing trends, customer retention patterns, and strategic opportunities for Instacart.

## Key Insights
- Strong **initial customer engagement**, but a significant **drop in repeat orders** (from 90,000 first-time customers to 22,000 second-time buyers).
- Customers consistently purchase **organic fruits, vegetables, and dairy products**, suggesting a preference for healthy options.
- **Order activity remains high** throughout most of the day, peaking during common meal-prep hours.
- The dataset lacks demographic details, making it difficult to fully assess the **retention challenge** without additional customer data.

## Strategic Recommendations
To address the retention gap and maximize profitability, Instacart should:
1. **Introduce targeted promotions** (e.g., offering a discount on bread when paired with fresh items) to encourage repeat purchases.
2. **Analyze customer engagement with promotions** to understand retention barriers.
3. **Collect additional customer data** (e.g., surveys on pricing sensitivity, delivery satisfaction) to refine retention strategies.
